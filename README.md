# Greenride

Hack on the Hill 2022.

## Our Vision

We've all heard of it before. Carbon emissions are bad for our globe!

But how easy is it to see how our everyday commute contributes to carbon emissions? Without an easy-to-use interface that provides tangible, customized feedback based on your travel method and routes, it's hard to know how we affect our local environments.

Greenride brings dynamic emissions and environmental metrics right where you need it most - on your maps, next to the routes you travel every day.

We want to make it easy for each individual to see how their daily commute affects their environment. And so we introduce to you... GREENRIDE!
